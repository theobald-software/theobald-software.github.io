Click the the main window "Extract SAP DataSources and Extractors" on **[Extraction Settings]**. The Dialog "DeltaQ Settings - [ExtractionName]" open.
The window consists of two tabs:
* Base
* Hierarchy

![XU_DeltaQ_Settings_thumb](/img/content/XU_DeltaQ_Settings_thumb.png){:class="img-responsive"}

### Base Tab

The base tab consists of two subsections:
- Transfer Mode
- Misc.

#### Transfer Mode

The raw data packages can be sent by SAP via *tRFC* call or *Data-IDoc*. Normally the tRFC is optimal for the default setting. If it is necessary, e.g. to examine the raw data packages for debugging reasons, you can change the transfer mode to *IDoc*. Then you can examine the data packages in the transaction WE02 (IDoc-Monitoring).

#### Misc.

**Automatic Synchronisation**<br>
Depending on the system landscape it could happen that developments only be performed in a test system. If SSIS packages should be used later in the production environment, the data source has to be enabled there. To avoid manual changes in the transactional system you can activate this option. In this case the activation will be automatically done and the timestamp of the data source will be changed that it will be consistent to the SAP system setting. <br>
If the DataSource was modified in the SAP system, e.g. a fieldâ€™s name, data type or length was changed or a field was excluded from data transfer, you will still have to manually activate the DataSource in the DeltaQ component, even if Automatic Synchronisation is switched on. Otherwise data load will fail. This behaviour is by SAP design and is described in [SAP help](https://help.sap.com/viewer/ccc9cdbdc6cd4eceaf1e5485b1bf8f4b/7.4.19/en-US/4a12eaff76df1b42e10000000a42189c.html).

**Add Serialization Info to Output**<br>
Adds the two columns *DataPackageID* and *RowCounter* to the output.<br>
In this Case the following three columns which are a composite key of the records delivered by SAP, will be available in the output:
- *RequestID*
- *DataPackageID* 
- *RowCounter*

{: .box-note }
**Note** Newer data have a higher PackageID. In the same package newer data have a higher RowCounter.

**Accept Gaps in DataPackage Id**<br>
The Delta Q component makes at the end of each extraction a consistency check. Only when all data packages have arrived correctly, the extraction is considered consistent. In the case that the customer has built a filter function in the user exit of an OLTP source that causes certain data packages to not be sent, the consistency check must be mitigated. 
Otherwise the customer filter function would be seen as inconsistency. If this option is activated, gaps in the packet numbering will not be counted by the DeltaQ as inconsistency but as intentionally withheld information. The option should only be used if a corresponding filter function exists in the user exit.

**Timeout (sec)**<br>
Defines a time period (in seconds) how long the Xtract Product will wait, after the extraction job on the SAP side is finished but not all tRFC calls have been received, yet.

#### Request Maintenance

To show and delete the init requests of this DataSource (requests in RSA7).

![DeltaQ_Request_Maintenance](/img/content/DeltaQ_Request_Maintenance.png){:class="img-responsive"}

- **Delete Request**<br>
    Delete the init requests (requests in RSA7).
- **Allow BW requests deletion**<br>
  	Allow the deletion of the initialisation requests of the export datasources in BW. 

### Hierarchy Tab

The hierarchie tab consists of two subsections:
- Extraction
- Natural Representation

![Deltaq-Preferences-Hierarchy](/img/content/Deltaq-Preferences-Hierarchy.png){:class="img-responsive"}

#### Extraction

**Language**<br>
Defines the Language, if a Hierarchy is extracted.

**Hierarchy Name**<br>
Defines the Hierarchy Name.

**Hierarchy Class**<br>
Defines the Hierarchy Class.

**Representation**<br>
- **ParentChild**: The hierarchy has the SAP parent-child format.
![Deltaq-Hierarchies-Parent-Child](/img/content/Deltaq-Hierarchies-Parent-Child.png){:class="img-responsive"}
- **Natural**: The section **Natural Representation** is activated. The parent child hierarchy will be transformed in a regular hierarchy.

#### Natural Representation

**Level Count**
Defines the maximum number of levels if the representation natural is selected. In the following screenshot you see the hierarchie shown in the previous screenshot with five levels in the representation *Natural*.

![Deltaq-Hierarchies-Parent-Child-Natural](/img/content/Deltaq-Hierarchies-Parent-Child-Natural.png){:class="img-responsive"}

**Fill empty levels** <br>
If the representation *Natural* is selected, the bottom element of the hierarchy will be copied until the last level. In the following screenshot you will see the hierarchy from above with the option *Repeat Leaves* activated.

![Deltaq-Hierarchies-Parent-Child-Repeat](/img/content/Deltaq-Hierarchies-Parent-Child-Repeat.png){:class="img-responsive"}

**Description texts for levels**<br>
Means, that the output has a field *LevelTextN* for each field *LevelN*, that contains the text based on the system language settings.

**Leaves only**<br>
Delivers only the leaves as data records.
