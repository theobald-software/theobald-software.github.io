### Variants and Selections
Most queries allow entering selections before query execution.
Selections limit the result set of the Query to extract only records that match the selection.<br>

A selection variant can be created in SAP at the selection screen of a Query. The purpose of a variant is to save selection settings. 
This minimizes the need to enter selections each time you run a query.

**Note:** Manual selections and variants can be combined. Manual selections overwrite any selections in the variant.

**Tip**: You can dynamize the variant by using a corresponding parameter in the extraction URL.


### Edit Selections
This section corresponds to the query's selection screen in SAP. Some selection fields only have a technical name and no description. 
To understand which field corresponds to a field in SAP, take a look at the query’s selection screen in SAP. 
Click on a selection field and press function key F1. This displays the technical name of a selection field.

In general, selection parameters overwrite the selected variant. 
This ensures that there are possible combinations for the selection.
