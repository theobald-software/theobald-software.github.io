### Connection Details

The tab *General* contains the connection details and is divided into four subsections:
- [General(#general)
- [Authentication](#authentication)
- [RFC Options](#rfc-options)
- [Access Control](#access-control)

Fill out the connection details to establish an SAP connection.

{: .box-tip }
**Tip:** Values to fill out the fields can be found in the SAP logon pad in the *Properties* or acquired from SAP Basis team.

### General

![XU-Create-Connection-3-A](/img/content/xu/sap_source-details.png){:class="img-responsive"}

#### System
There are two possibilities to connect to an SAP source system:
- Use a Single Application Server
	- **Host**:  host name or IP address of the application server (Property Host) 
	- **Instance No**: a two-digit number between 00 and 99 (Property SystemNumber)

- Use a Load Balancing Server (message server)
	- **Message Server**: name or IP address of the message server (Property MessageServer) 
	- **Group**: property LogonGroup, usually *PUBLIC*
	- **SID**: three-digit System ID (Property SID e.g.,  MSS) 
See also SAP online help: [Load Balancing](https://help.sap.com/saphelp_nwpi711/helpdata/en/c4/3a644c505211d189550000e829fbbd/content.htm?no_cache=true).


#### Accessing via SAP Router

If you access the SAP source system (Application server or Message server) via an SAP router, set the router string before the host name. <br>
Example:<br>
If the application server is "hamlet" and the router string is ``/H/lear.theobald-software.com/H/``, set the host property to ``/H/lear.theobald-software.com/H/hamlet``.

See also SAP online help: [SAP-Router](https://help.sap.com/saphelp_snc700_ehp01/helpdata/en/48/6e2ef629540e27e10000000a421937/frameset.htm).

{: .box-tip }
**Tip:** Values to fill out the forms can be found in the SAP logon pad in the *Properties* or acquired from SAP Basis team.


#### Client and Language
- Client - a three-digit number of the SAP client between 000 and 999, e.g., 800.
- Language - the logon language for the SAP system, e.g., EN for English or DE for German.


### Authentication
The following authentication methods are supported:
-  Plain (1) - SAP username and password (system or dialogue user)
- SNC (Secure Network Communication) (2) with username and password
- [SNC with SSO](../advanced-techniques/sap-single-sign-on) (Single Sign On) (3)
	
![XU-Authentication](/img/content/xu/sap-details-authentication.png){:class="img-responsive"} 
You can additionally use [SAP Log On Ticket](../advanced-techniques/sap-single-sign-on/sso-with-sap-logon-ticket) for authentication (available only for several connectors, e.g., ERPConnect, ERPConnect Services, Xtract Universal and BOARD Connector).


**Require SAP credentials to be explicitly supplied for execution** (4) <br>
Option available only when using *Plain* or *SNC* authentication method. SAP credentials entered in the *User* and *Password* fields are not applied.
Instead, SAP credentials need to be provided via basic authentication when executing an extraction. 
Caching the result of extractions is inactive. 

**Xtract Universal only:** See [Power BI Connector](https://help.theobald-software.com/en/xtract-universal/destinations/Power-BI-Connector#pbi-SSO) or [Alteryx](https://help.theobald-software.com/en/xtract-universal/destinations/alteryx#settings-in-alteryx) destinations for possible examples. 

{: .box-note }
**Note:** The option "Require SAP credentials to be explicitly supplied for execution" requires extractions to be called via [HTTPS - unrestricted](../server/server-settings#web-server).

#### SNC 

1. Check the SAP parameter snc/gssapi_lib to determine, which library is used for encryption in your SAP system.
Your SAP basis has to import and configure the same library on the application server and on the machine with installed Xtract Universal or BOARD Connector.
2. In the **SNC library** field, fill in the complete path to the library location e.g., `C:\Program Files\SAP\FrontEnd\SecureLogin\lib\sapcrypto.dll`.
3. Fill in the SAP **Partner Name** configured for the SAP application server e.g., `p:SAPserviceERP/do_not_care@THEOBALD.LOCAL`.

For additional details see the knowledge base article [Enabling Secure Network Communication (SNC) via X.509 certificate](https://kb.theobald-software.com/sap/enable-snc-using-pse-file).

When working with Kerberos library, follow the steps described in [SSO with Kerberos SNC](../advanced-techniques/sap-single-sign-on/sso-with-kerberos-snc).


### RFC Options
Select a library and optionally define a trace directory for debug logging.

#### RFC libraries
The RFC API (Remote Function Call) allows to establish an RFC connection to an SAP system from an external system that communicates as Client or Server with the SAP system.  
There are two options for using RFC libraries:
- Use classic RFC library (librfc32.dll)
- Use NetWeaver RFC libraries (sapnwrfc.dll)


See additional information on SAP libraries on the [SAP Help Site - RFC Libraries](https://help.sap.com/saphelp_nwpi71/helpdata/de/45/18e96cd26321a1e10000000a1553f6/frameset.htm). <br>

SAP has stopped [supporting librfc32.dll](https://blogs.sap.com/2012/08/15/support-for-classic-rfc-library-ends-march-2016/). 

{: .box-note }
**Note:** When using the NetWeaver RFC library with DeltaQ or OHS extractions, the RFC destination in SM59 must be set to Unicode. 


#### Trace Directory

You can log debug information and save it locally. Fill the **Trace directory** field with a local path to a folder, where you want to save the debug information.

{: .box-warning }
**Warning!: Increase of used hard drive memory** <br>
A big amount of information is collected when debug logging is activated. This can decrease the capacity of your hard drives dramatically.
Activate the debug logging only when necessary e.g., upon request of the support team.

### Access Control

### Test Connection

Click **[Test Connection]** (1) to test the successful connection. 
The confirmation window opens. <br>
The SAP connection is set up successfully. 
![XU-Create-Connection-3](/img/content/xu_test_connection.png){:class="img-responsive"}

### To Check the New SAP Connection
1. In the main window of the Designer, navigate to the menu bar and select the menu item **Server > Manage Sources**.<br>
The window "Manage Sources" opens. <br>
2. Check if created SAP connection is listed.
