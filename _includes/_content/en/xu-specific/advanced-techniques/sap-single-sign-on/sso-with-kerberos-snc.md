The following section describes the required steps for setting up Single Sign-On (SSO) with Secure Network Communication (SNC) and Kerberos encryption.

{: .box-warning }
**Warning!  Single Sign-On availability** <br> 
ABAP application server has to run on a Windows OS and SNC with Kerberos encryption setup on SAP. <br>


### What is SNC?

Secure Network Connection (SNC) secures the data communication paths to your SAP system. 
SNC offers cryptographic algorithms you can apply to your data for increased protection and application-level end-to-end security.<br>
All communication that takes place between two SNC-protected components is secured e.g., between the SAP application server and Theobald products.

There are three levels of security protection you can apply with SNC:
- Authentication only
- Integrity protection
- Privacy protection

For more information on SNC, see [SAP Help: SNC](https://help.sap.com/doc/saphelp_nw73ehp1/7.31.19/en-US/e6/56f466e99a11d1a5b00000e835363f/content.htm?no_cache=true).

### Activation of HTTPS 

1. Enable access control protocol HTTPS (1) within the tab *Web Server* settings.
2. Reference an existing [X.509 certificate](../../security/install-x.509-Certificate) (2).<br>
3. Click **[OK]** to confirm (3)<br>

{: .box-note }
**Note:** Make sure to check the default ports depending on your product. HTTPS port *8165* is e.g., set up by default in Xtract Universal. BOARD Connector's default HTTPS port *8197*.

### Configuration of Windows AD service account
Using SSO with Kerberos SNC, the Xtract Universal service must run under a dedicated service account.  
To do so, follow the steps as outlined in [Running the Xtract Universal Service under a Windows Service Account](../service-account).

{: .box-note }
**Note:** As of Xtract Universal version 5.0 SAP passwords are encrypted with a key that is derived from the Windows account that runs the XU service.
The passwords can only be accessed from the same service account, when restoring a backup or moving the files to a different machine. 
If the service account changes, passwords need to be re-entered manually.

### Server Settings

{: .box-warning}
**Warning! Incompatible library**  <br>
Xtract products run on 64bit OS only. Kerberos Wrapper Library gx64krb5.dll(64-Bit version) is required. <br>
Download `gx64krb5.dll` from [SAP Note 2115486](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2115486).

1. Copy the Kerberos Wrapper Library to the file system, e.g., to `C:\SNC\gx64krb5.dll` of the machine, where the service is running.
2. Place the downloaded .dll file on each machine, where the Designer is running.
3. Open "Computer Management" by entering the following command: `compmgmt.msc`.
4. Under **Local Users and Groups** select **Groups > Administrators**.
5. Click **[Add]** (4) to add the service account to the local admin group (5).<br>
![XU_SSO_WinAD_SPN](/img/content/admin_groups_xu_service_account.png)
6. Open "Local Security policy" by entering the following command: `secpol.msc`. <br>
![XU_SSO_LocSecPol](/img/content/XU_SSO_LocSecPol.png){:class="img-responsive"}
7. Select **[Local Policies > User Rights Assignment]**
    - Act as part of the operating system 
    - Impersonate a client after authentication
8. Change the registry settings of the server machine:

**Field** | **Registry Entry**
------------ | -------------
SubKey | HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\SAP\gsskrb5
Entry | ForceIniCredOK
Type | REG_DWORD
Value | 1


### SAP Source Settings

{: .box-note }
**Note:** An existing [SAP connection](../../introduction/sap-connection) to a Single Application Server or Message Server is the prerequisite for using SSO with SNC.

1. In the main menu of the Designer, navigate to **[Server > Manage Sources]**. The window "Source Details" opens.<br>
![XU_SSO_SAPSource](/img/content/XU_SSO_SAP_Source.png){:class="img-responsive"}
2. Select an existing SAP source and click **[Edit]** (pencil symbol).<br>
![Edit-SAP-source](/img/content/edit_sap_source.png){:class="img-responsive"}
3. Enable the **SNC** option (1) in the subsection *Authentication*.
4. Enable the checkbox *Impersonate authenticated caller (SSO)* (2).
5. Enter the complete path of the Kerberos library in the field *SNC library*
e.g., `C:\SNC\gx64krb5.dll` (3).
6. Enter the SPN of the SAP service account in the field *Partner name*. Use the following notation: *p:[SPN]@[Domain-FQDN-Uppercase]* (4). 
7. Click **[Test Connection]** to verify your connection settings.
8. Click **[OK]** to confirm.

{: .box-note}
**Note:** The SAP Logon Pad SNC settings for partner name differ from the ones used in Xtract products. SAP Logon Pad uses the UPN of the SAP service accounts and Xtract products use the Service Principal Name (SPN). Use the following notation: *p:[SAP Service Account]@[domain]*. SPN's are case sensitive in the SNC partner name.


### SNC Activation in SAP

In SAP, apply the Kerberos SNC settings as described in the [SAP Help](https://help.sap.com/viewer/e815bb97839a4d83be6c4fca48ee5777/7.5.9/EN-US/440ebf6c9b2b0d1ae10000000a114a6b.html).
