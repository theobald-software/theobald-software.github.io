### File Name

*File Name* determines the name of the target table. You have the following options:
- **Same as name of SAP object**: Copy the name of the SAP object
- **Same as name of extraction**: Adopt name of extraction
- **Custom**: Here you can define your own name.  

- **Append timestamp**: adds the timestamp in the UTC format (_YYYY_MM_DD_hh_mm_ss_fff) to the file name of the extraction.
