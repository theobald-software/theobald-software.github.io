4 GB dedicated memory in average for each additional parallel extraction.
You must check the exact storage requirements of an extraction in your scenario.<br>

Memory consumption depends on many factors including component type (i.e. Table, Extractor or BW Query), number of columns and number of rows in each data package (i.e. package size). <br> 
E.g. the BW Cube component needs for extracting and processing data more main memory space than the Table component for the same data amount.
