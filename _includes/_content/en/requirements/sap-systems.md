### Supported SAP Systems and Releases
All communication with SAP is performed via the RFC protocol. 
All SAP ABAP based systems that provide RFC connectivity are supported.
The integration occurs at SAP application server level. Therefore, the database used by the SAP system is irrelevant. 
SAP ABAP Systems on any database (including HANA) are supported. 
This means that the operating system of the SAP system is irrelevant - all operating systems are supported.
SAP Systems running on Big Endian and Little Endian hardware are supported.

SAP Releases 4.6C and newer are supported. Including the following:
<br/> 	
* mySAP
* SAP Application Server ABAP, Message Server, Router, Standalone Gateway
* SAP Business Suite 7 (CRM, SRM, SCM etc.)
* SAP Business All in One, CAR, APO, PI, IS-U etc.

### Not supported SAP Systems
Not supported are the SAP systems that donâ€™t run on ABAP systems or don't provide RFC connectivity. For example, the following systems are not supported:
- SAP S/4HANA Cloud Essentials Edition (ES)
- Business By Design 
- Business One
- Business Objects

### HANA Database
You can use Operational Data Provisioning (ODP) to connect the SAP HANA database of an SAP ABAP source system. 
Communication is done via RFC. 
With the ODP context for SAP HANA (HANA) the following HANA View types are available for extracting:
- Analysis Views
- Calculation Views
- Associated Attribute Views

Direct access to a HANA database without an SAP ABAP source system running on the corresponding HANA database is not supported.
