### Installing update or a new version -- Test environment
To install a newer software version over an existing version, follow the steps below. 

### Preparation 

1. Recommendations:
 - Use a working test environment with a valid license and maintenance. The test environment is a copy of the current production environment   
 - Update the software regularly, especially for major changes and high (**[H]**) priority update recommendations in the [version history](https://kb.theobald-software.com/version-history).
 - Create a [backup](#how-to-create-a-backup) of the current installation.

2. Before updating, check the [Version History](https://kb.theobald-software.com/version-history) and release notes in the knowledge base.   
 - Make any necessary preparations and changes as described in the Release Note / Version History, especially for major changes and high priority (**[H]**) update recommendations.
 - You can subscribe via [e-mail](mailto:info@theobald-software.com) to Theobald Software's regular newsletter that informs about changes in the version history and release notes.  

### Installation Process
A newer version can be installed over the old version. It is not necessary to uninstall the previous version. 
New versions are available via our [customer portal](https://my.theobald-software.com).

During the installation, the setup program checks whether other processes are running in the background that are related to the software being installed. If this is the case, a message with various options is displayed: 
- Check Again - you can close the affected programs, then click **[Check Again]** to continue the installation. 
- Kill Process - you can kill the affected process and continue with the installation.
- Ignore - you can ignore the message, but the installation may be cancelled due to the locking of certain files.
- Quit Install - you can cancel the installation and resume it at another time.


First install the current version of the software on the test environment and test the new version carefully. 
 - Test all your existing projects.  
 - After a successful test, follow the steps to install the current version on the [production environment](#installing-an-update----production-environment), see the corresponding section below.    
 - In the case of an error, create a ticket in the [Support Portal](https://support.theobald-software.com). Register if you do not have a customer account yet. Use your backup until a solution is provided.


### Installing an Update -- Production Environment 
After sucessfull installation and test of the update version on the test environment, follow the corresponding steps described above for the production environment. Make sure to create a backup beforehand and conduct all the necessary preparations and changes.
