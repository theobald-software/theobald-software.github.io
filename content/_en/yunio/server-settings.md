### Transport Layer Security

Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol allows the user to communicate with the respective service in a secure way by encrypting the communication with that service (HTTPS).
This requires the installation of an X.509 certificate.
For more information on TLS, see [Microsoft: Transport Layer Security Protocol](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/transport-layer-security-protocol).

#### Pick Certificate
Click **[Pick Certificate]** and select an X.509 certificate from the list of available certificates.<br>
If the certificate is not listed in the menu or in the Windows certificate store, install the X.509 certificate.

{: .box-note }
**Note:** Depending on whether yunIO is hosted on a local server or a cloud environment, the procedure for certificate creation differs.
Please refer to the documentation available on the internet or contact your network administrators.

#### TLS enabled
Once a certificate is selected, the option **TLS enabled** is available.<br>
Enable or disable the usage of transport encryption for the web server.

### Allowed Origins (CORS)

{: .box-warning }
**Warning! Cross-Origin Request Blocked** When encountering a CORS error, the URL of your origin is not authorized to send requests to yunIO. Add the URL of your origin to the list of allowed origins.

Enter URLs that are allowed to run cross-origin requests on yunIO.<br>
Example: To allow a tool like Swagger Inspector to load and execute a yunIO service, the URL `https://inspector.swagger.io` must be added to the list of allowed origins.

{: .box-note }
**Note:** For testing purposes you can use ( * ) to allow all URLs. When first installing yunIO this is set by default.
