Welcome to the Online Help for yunIO. 

yunIO is a no-code application for designing, automating, and integrating SAP processes in the cloud. <br>
The service offers easy integration of SAP data and business processes in different platforms and applications. 

### Software Architecture

yunIO comes with an embedded Web UI, the yunIO Designer, that can be accessed through a standard web browser. A Windows service enables connectivity with SAP. <br>
The yunIO service is installed on a local or cloud-hosted Windows server environment. <br>
If yunIO is installed on a local server environment, a Gateway instance of your choice (e.g. Microsoft om-premises data gateway) can be used for securely tunnel the connection. <br>
