### About the Licensing Concept of yunIO

yunIO is licensed per Windows server where the solution is installed.
A demo license valid for 30 days is automatically provided with the installation of yunIO.

A regular license is provided in the [Theobald Software Costumer Portal](https://my.theobald-software.com/) after purchasing the product. 
The product license is bound to your company and the server on which the yunIO server runs.<br>
