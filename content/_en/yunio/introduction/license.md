### About the Licensing Concept of yunIO

yunIO is licensed per Windows server where the solution is installed.
A demo license valid for 30 days is automatically provided with the installation of yunIO.

A regular license is provided in the [costumer portal - My Theobald Software](https://my.theobald-software.com/) after purchasing the product. 
The product license is bound to your company and the server on which the yunIO server runs.<br>
 

### Installing the yunIO License - yunIOLicense.json
For installing the regular license, place the regular yunIOLicense.json into the following directory of the server: <br>
`C:\Program Files\Theobald Software\YunIO`

A restart of the yunIO service is not necessary.<br>
To inspect your current license data, go to the main menu of yunIO and navigate to **[About]**. 
The version number is displayed next to the page title.
