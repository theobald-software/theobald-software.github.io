With **ECS Core**, programmers have an excellent tool for developing applications for SharePoint Online/Office 365 and other cloud or non-cloud based environments. 

Applications with ECS Core can use any programming language that can consume REST API.

**JavaScript library f√ºr REST**

For development with ECS REST Services and JavaScript we recommend the use of our [JavaScript library](https://cdn-files.theobald-software.com/static/theobald.ecs.micro/5.7.0/index.html) (tEcs),  
which simplifies client-side programming with ECS by encapsulating certain ECS functionalities.
