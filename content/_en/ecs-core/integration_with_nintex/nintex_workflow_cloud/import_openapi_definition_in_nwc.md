To import an OpenAPI definition into the NWC, log into your NWC Tenant as administrator and open the Xtensions section. Here you can add custom connectors with OpenAPI. Select the saved OpenAPI definition and click *Next*.

In the *Security* section APIKey is preselected as authentication method. The use of other authentication methods such as Basic must be explicitly specified in the definition. You can keep the default values for name and location and click on *Next*.

Then enter a name and description and select an icon. You publish the connector with *Publish*.

After publishing, the custom connector is automatically available in the NWC Workflow Designer.
