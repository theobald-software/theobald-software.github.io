You need a valid software license to use ECS Core. The *License* tab shows the current license. A test license valid for 30 days is already stored by default. 

When you purchase the software, you will receive a new license key *ECSCoreLicense.json*, which you must store in the directory C://ECSCore on the Windows server. Select the key with *Browse* and add it 
with "apply.
