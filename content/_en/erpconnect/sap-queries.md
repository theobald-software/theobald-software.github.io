### About SAP Queries
SAP Queries are used to access data sets, see [SAP Help - Working with Queries](https://help.sap.com/viewer/b1c834a22d05483b8a75710743b5ff26/7.51.6/en-US/0e05493bbccf41a79caed7099c82bd48.html) for more information.

The input image of a Query is filled using the *SelectParameters* collection. 
Every input parameter can contain an arbitrary number of values. 
The values are represented by ranges.
In addition, a query object contains a *Fields* collection that in turn contains the output fields.

The figure below shows the object hierarchy that is provided by the Queries classes in ERPConnect.<br>
