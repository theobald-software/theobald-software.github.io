This section shows how to use ERPConnect's special classes.

Besides the standard classes for the RFC server and client functions, there are several special classes included in the ERPConnect toolkit:
- The [*ReadTable*](./special-classes/reading-sap-tables-directly-with-readtable) class reads data directly from SAP tables.
- The [*ABAPCode*](./special-classes/abap-code) class enables the execution of ABAP code in your application.
- The [*Transaction*](./special-classes/managing-and-executing-transactions-the-class-transaction) class manages and executes transactions.
 
These special classes encapsulate recurrent tasks and are all located in the namespace *ERPConnect.Utils*.
