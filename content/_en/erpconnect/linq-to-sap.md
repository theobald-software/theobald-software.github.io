**Warning! Deprecated component** 
As of Visual Studio Version 2019 the *LINQ to SAP* add-on is not supported anymore.

*LINQ to SAP* is an exclusive add-on for ERPConnect that integrates Microsoftâ€™s [Language Integrated Query (LINQ)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/) to provide native data querying capabilities. 
The add-on comes with a Designer for more user-friendliness.

LINQ to SAP is an exclusive add-on for ERPConnect. It builds internally on ERPConnect and does not exist as a stand-alone tool. 
Thus any existing ERPConnect code is always compatible with *LINQ to SAP*. 
To distribute a finished application to customers, give them is the ERPConnect35.dll (or higher). 
No other .dlls are needed.

### Technical Prerequisites

- Microsoft.NET 3.5 (or higher). Previous .NET versions do not support LINQ.
- Visual Studio 2008 or higher (excluding Express).

More information on working with *LINQ to SAP* is provided in the following sections.
