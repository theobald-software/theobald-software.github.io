This section shows how to receive and process a *MATMAS* IDoc.
To configure your SAP system to send *MATMAS* IDocs, see [Setting Up a Test Environment for IDocs](./prerequisites#setting-up-a-test-environment-for-idocs).

### Receiving a MATMAS IDoc

1. Create an RFC Server object to accept calls from SAP, see [RFC Server](../rfc-server/example) for more information.
2. To receive IDocs with the *RFCServer* object, set the property *CanReceiveIdocs* to true.<br>
3. When an IDoc is received by ERPConnect, the event *IncomingIdoc* is triggered and a reference to the *RFCServer* object and to the *IDoc* object is transferred. 
Use this event to process the IDoc object as shown in the code below. <br>
```csharp
static void Main(string[] args) 
{ 
   // define server object and start 
   RFCServer s = new RFCServer(); 
   s.Logging = true; 
   s.GatewayHost = "sap-erp-as05.example.com"; 
   s.GatewayService = "sapgw11"; 
   s.ProgramID = "ERPTEST"; 
   s.CanReceiveIdocs = true; 
   s.IncomingIdoc+= new ERPConnect.RFCServer.OnIncomingIdoc(s_IncomingIdoc); 
   s.InternalException+= new ERPConnect.RFCServer.OnInternalException (s_InternalException); 
   s.Start(); 
  
   Console.WriteLine("Server is running. Press any key to exit."); 
   Console.ReadLine(); 
   s.Stop(); 
}
```

### Processing a Received IDoc

In this example the received IDoc contains material descriptions that can be written into the console window to check the contents of the IDoc. <br> 
The IDoc is analyzed using the *E2MARAM005* segment. 
Within this segment, several *E2MAKTM001* child segments contain material descriptions.

{: .box-note }
**Note**: You can use the transaction **WE60** to look up the structures of IDocs in SAP.

1. Read the data buffer with the *ReadDataBuffer* method to access the description texts in the child segment *E2MAKTM001*. 
The description text is located at index 4 with a length of 40. <br>
```csharp
private static void s_IncomingIdoc(RFCServer Sender, Idoc idoc) 
{ 
   Console.WriteLine("Received Idoc " + idoc.IDOCTYP); 
   IdocSegment e2maram = idoc.Segments["E2MARAM005",0]; 
   for (int i=0; i < e2maram.ChildSegments.Count;i++) 
   { 
      if (e2maram.ChildSegments[i].SegmentName == "E2MAKTM001") 
      { 
         Console.WriteLine("Materialtext found: " + 
            e1maram.ChildSegments[i].ReadDataBuffer(4,40)); 
      } 
   } 
}
```
2. Write the description texts into the console window.
3. Run the program, send an IDoc in SAP and check the result. 
In this case, 5 *E2MAKTM001* segments were found so 5 texts are passed. <br>

**Note**: If you do not want to read the data buffer with offset and length of the texts, you can load an XML Schema instead, see [Using XMLs for IDocs](./xml-support-for-idoc-programming).
