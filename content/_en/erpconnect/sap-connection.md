**Warning: Deprecated documentation** <br>
You are using the old version of the online help for ERPConnect.<br>
Make sure to use the documentation within the new [HelpCenter for ERPConnect](https://helpcenter.theobald-software.com/erpconnect/documentation/introduction/).

This section contains information on connection to SAP systems and is therefore a prerequisite for all subsequent sections.

### RFC Library (API)
The RFC API (Remote Function Call) enables an RFC connection between an SAP system and an external system that can communicate with SAP as a client or server.

The RFC API has two versions:
- classic RFC-API (classic RFC library).
- Netweaver-RFC-API (Netweaver RFC library). 

For more information on the RFC libraries, see [SAP Help - RFC API: Classical & NetWeaver](https://help.sap.com/saphelp_nwpi71/helpdata/en/45/18e96cd26321a1e10000000a1553f6/frameset.htm).
