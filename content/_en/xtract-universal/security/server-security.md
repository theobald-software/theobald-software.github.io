### About

This section is about restricting access to Xtract Universal/Board Connector's built in web server to predefined users or user groups. <br>
By setting access restrictions on the web server you ensure that only dedicated users can execute extractions. 

There are two types of [users and user groups](user-management#users-and-user-groups), access can be restricted to. 
- Windows AD users (Kerberos authentication)
- custom users (Basic authentication) 

When access to the web server is restricted, Windows AD credentials or credentials of a custom user must be submitted when running an extraction.

{: .box-note }
**Note:** For information on how to call an extraction with Basic Authentication through *xu.exe*, see [Basic Authentication via Commandline](../execute-and-automate-extractions/call-via-commandline#basic-authentication-via-commandline).

### Running a service under a Windows service account

When restricting access to Windows AD users, the Xtract Universal service must run under a dedicated service account. To do that, follow the steps in [Running the Xtract Universal Service under a Windows Service Account](../advanced-techniques/service-account).
