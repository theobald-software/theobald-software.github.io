**Warning: Deprecated documentation** <br>
You are using the old version of the online help for Xtract Universal.<br>
Make sure to use the documentation within the new [Xtract Universal HelpCenter](https://helpcenter.theobald-software.com/xtract-universal/documentation/introduction/).

An extraction has two types of settings: the *Extraction Settings* include settings that affect only the respective extraction type, while [*General Settings*](../getting-started/general-settings) are the same for all extraction types.
