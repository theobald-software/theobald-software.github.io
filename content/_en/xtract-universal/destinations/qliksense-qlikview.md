**Warning: Deprecated documentation** <br>
You are using the old version of the online help for Xtract Universal.<br>
Make sure to use the documentation within the new [Xtract Universal HelpCenter](https://helpcenter.theobald-software.com/xtract-universal/documentation/introduction/).

The following sections describe how Xtract Universal connects with QlikSense or QlikView.

For connection purposes Xtract Universal offers a destination of type *QlikSense & QlikView*. The QlikSense & QlikView destination generates a data load script, which needs to be inserted into the data load editor of your Qlik application. Depending on whether you run a QlikSense of QlikView application, Xtract Univeral creates a different data load script.

Running the Qlik application triggers the respective Xtract Universal extraction via the data load script. Xtract Universal sends the extracted SAP data through an HTTP-CSV stream directly to your Qlik application.

## Requirements

There are no particular technical prerequisites for using the QlikSense & QlikView destination.


## Connection

## Generating a Data Load Script

### Displaying the Qlik Data Load Script
1. Run an extraction with a "QlikSense & QlikView" destination. The window "Run Extraction" opens.
![XU_qlik_generate_Script](/img/content/xu/XU_qlik_generate_Script.png){:class="img-responsive"}
2. *Optional (when using QlikSense)*: In the *Parameters* section, mark the check boxes for the parameters which you wish to add as SET variables in the QlikSense script.
3. Click **[Generate Qlik Script]** to generate a data load script. The window "Script" opens.

### Further Processing of the Script
1. Select the *QlikView Script* or *QlikSense Script* tab.
2. Click **[Copy to Clipboard]** to copy the script.
![XU_qlik_generate_Script](/img/content/XU_qlik_generate_Script_2.png){:class="img-responsive"}
3. When using QlikView, paste the copied script into the QlikView data load editor. For QlikSense, see section [Settings in QlikSense](#settings-in-qlik-sense).

{: .box-note }
**Note:** The "SET methods" cannot be edited in the "Script" window. Edit the SET methods in the Qlik data load editor. 


## Settings in QlikSense

### Triggering an Extraction from QlikSense

Before copying the Qlik script generated by Xtract Universal to QlikSense, perform the following steps in QlikSense:

1. Create a new data connection of type REST. <br>
**Note**: In QlikSense the default value for the *Timeout* is 30 seconds. Increase the timeout to a sufficiently high value if the time till the first data package arrives from SAP is higher than 30 seconds. The maximum input value is 10.000 seconds.
2. Enter the URL of the Xtract Universal Server and port into the URL text field. In the example below, the Xtract Universal server is running on `http://localhost:8065/`.
3. Enter *Xtract_Universal* into the name text field.
![XU_qlik_QlikSense_data_connection](/img/content/XU_qlik_QlikSense_data_connection.png){:class="img-responsive"}
4. Activate the security option **Allow response headers**. This option ensures that error messages from Xtract Universal are passed to QlikSense.<br>
![qlik-allow-response-headers](/img/content/xu/qlik-allow-response-headers.png){:class="img-responsive"}
5. Paste the QlikSense script from Xtract Universal into the QlikSense Data load editor.<br>
![XU_qlik_QlikSense_load_editor](/img/content/XU_qlik_QlikSense_load_editor.png){:class="img-responsive"}


{: .box-warning }
**Warning! The following error occurred: Response headers are denied by the current connection. Please edit your connection in order to enable response headers loading.**
When this error message is displayed in the REST connection, activate the option "Allow response headers" in the *Security* settings of the connector.

### QlikSense Data Load Script Explanation

Xtract Universal creates a QlikSense script with the following properties:
- The script uses QlikSense [interpretation functions](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense/June2020/Subsystems/Hub/Content/Sense_Hub/Scripting/InterpretationFunctions/interpretation-functions.htm) *Num#*, *Text*, *Date* and *Time*. For fields, where an adequate data type can't be determined, no interpretation function is used.
- The field description and the SAP origin of the field are assigned as tags to all fields.
- All date fields with *$date* are explicitly tagged. This function assures that fields containing a [date before January 1, 1980](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense/April2020/Subsystems/Hub/Content/Sense_Hub/Scripting/date-time-interpretation.htm) are recognized as date fields in QlikSense.
- The usage of Xtract Universal [Extraction Parameters](../execute-and-automate-extractions/extraction-parameters) is supported. 
To make parameters available in the QlikSense script, activate the parameters in the "Run Extraction" window of the Xtract Universal Designer.<br>
![XU_qlik_QlikSense_XUParameter](/img/content/XU_qlik_QlikSense_XUParameter.png){:class="img-responsive"}

{: .box-note }
**Note:** Do not change the assigned value of variables *xuOriginDateFormat* and *xuOriginTimeFormat*.
The chosen format enables Xtract Universal to send the data of date and time fields to QlikSense. Changing the format stops the QlikSense script from running.


## Migration from Xtract QV

You have Xtract QV installed, have defined your SAP source system(s) and extractions and use them as a data source in your qlik applications.

If you want to migrate this scenario to Xtract Universal, refer to [info@theobald-software.com](mailto:info@theobald-software.com) or [info@us.theobald-software.com](mailto:info@us.theobald-software.com).
We will provide you with all relevant information regarding this migration process.
