You are using the old version of the online help for Xtract Universal.<br>
Make sure to use the documentation within the new [Xtract Universal HelpCenter](https://helpcenter.theobald-software.com/xtract-universal/documentation/introduction/).

For testing purposes extractions can be called via web service.
Calling extractions is usually done via script, scheduler or BI-tool.
