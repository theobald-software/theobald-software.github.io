In addition to the logging server the log of each extraction process can be called from the main screen by clicking the *Log* button.

Here you will find on the left side a time stamp for each extraction process, which can be shown by clicking.

If you want to send a report via mail to the support, please make sure that the debug details are always showed to provide as much information as possible.

Both server and extraction logs are automatically deleted after a defined period. The period can be set in the server configuration.
