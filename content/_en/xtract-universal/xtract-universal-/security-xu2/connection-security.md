In the Security tab you can define the access rights for the SAP connection. 

![Connection-Security](/img/content/Connection-Security.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}          

**Allow everybody to access this connection** <br>
Everybody can access this connection.

**Allow only specific users/groups** <br>
Only specified users/user groups can access this connection.

The list *Allowed* contains users and user groups who have access to the connection. 
The list *Available* contains all defined users and users groups. With the buttons < and > you can switch users and users groups between the two lists. 

Only users with admin rights can create or edit connections and manage the access security. 
A connection can only be used by authorized users to create or edit connections. Unauthorized users would get an error message.
