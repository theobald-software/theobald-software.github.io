In order to use the Alteryx destination the Xtract Universal Alteryx plugin for the Alteryx designer is required. 

**Installation using the Xtract Universal Setup:** <br>
The Xtract Universal Setup will install the Xtract Universal Alteryx plugin if there is a valid Alteryx installation on the current system.
If you install Alteryx after installing Xtract Universal, either run the Xtract Universal setup again or do a manual installation of the plugin (see below)

**Manual installation (for a separate Alteryx system):**<br>
Copy the alteryx folder *[XtractUniversal]\alteryx* (e.g. C:\Program Files\XtractUniversal\alteryx) from your local Xtract Universal installation directory to any directory on the system you want to install the plugin on. 

Open the alteryx folder and run the setup file AlteryxPluginSetup.exe (right mouse - Run as Administrator). Done.

Should you encounter issues with the installation of the plugin, such as the plugin is not showing in alteryx, please send the setup.log file from the alteryx folder to Theobald Software support.
