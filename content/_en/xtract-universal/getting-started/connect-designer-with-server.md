### Connecting to a server
1. Launch the Xtract Universal Designer.
2. Connect the Designer to the Xtract Universal Server and the extraction repository.
- When Xtract Universal Server is a local server, the server address is then *localhost*.<br>
The default port (8064) may vary depending on the configuration.

- When the Xtract Universal Designer and the Xtract Universal Server are not running on the same machine, type
 in the host name the Xtract Universal Server is running on. Make sure the port is not blocked by your firewall.
3. If the service is not running on default port 8064 (can be configured in the server settings), specify the port by adding [:[port]](../server/ports) after the host name.

### Authentication
Xtract Universal offers different methods of authenticating and securing the connection between 
designer and server. Default authentication methods are authentication via *Windows credentials (current user)* and *Anonymous (no encryption)*.
