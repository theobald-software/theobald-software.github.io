An extraction has two types of settings. 
The *Extraction Settings* include settings that affect only the respective extraction type, while [*General Settings*](../getting-started/general-settings) are the same for all extraction types. 

### Opening Extraction Settings
In the window "Extract Single and Joint SAP Tables or Views" click **Extraction Settings**. The window "Table Settings" opens.
