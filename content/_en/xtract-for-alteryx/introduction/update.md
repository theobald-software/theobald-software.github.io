### How to create a backup?
1. Copy all Alteryx workflows that use Xtract for Alteryx.
2. Copy the folder that contains the SAP connections. 
Depending on the Alteryx Settings it is located in:
- `C:\Users\[USERNAME]\AppData\Roaming\Theobald Software\Xtract for Alteryx\Connections`

A backup is also recommended when updating the version of Alteryx Desktop or Server. 
We recommend that you create a backup at regular intervals so that you can easily switch back to the previous version if necessary.
Also note the product version that you are currently using so that you can switch back to the same version in the event of an error.
