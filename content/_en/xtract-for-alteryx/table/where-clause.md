**Warning: Deprecated documentation** <br>
You are using the old version of the online help for Xtract for Alteryx.<br>
Make sure to use the documentation within the new [Xtract for Alteryx](https://helpcenter.theobald-software.com/xtract-for-alteryx/documentation/introduction/).

A WHERE clause can be used to filter table records, see [SAP ABAP Documentation: SELECT-WHERE](https://help.sap.com/doc/abapdocu_750_index_htm/7.50/en-us/abapwhere.htm).

<!--- When defining a WHERE clause, you may want to adjust the following:
- [*Extraction Settings*](./extraction-settings). 
- [*Runtime parameters*](#runtime-parameters-in-the-where-clause-editor).--->

{% include _content/en/tables/where-clause.md %}
{% include _content/en/tables/where-clause-syntax.md%}
{% include _content/en/tables/where-clause-editor.md%}

### Runtime Parameters 
You can create and assign [runtime parameters](./edit-runtime-parameters), when using WHERE Clause.
