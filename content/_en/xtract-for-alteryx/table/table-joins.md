The prerequisite for using the join functionality is the installation of the function module [/THEO/READ_TABLE](../sap-customizing) in SAP.

### Join Functionality

In the *Joins* tab you can define Table Joins.
![Table join ](/img/content/table-join-tab.png){:class="img-responsive"}

{% include _content/en/tables/table-joins.md  %}
