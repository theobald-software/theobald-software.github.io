**Warning: Deprecated documentation** <br>
You are using the old version of the online help for Xtract for Alteryx.<br>
Make sure to use the documentation within the new [Xtract for Alteryx](https://helpcenter.theobald-software.com/xtract-for-alteryx/documentation/introduction/).

The prerequisite for using the join functionality is the installation of the function module [/THEO/READ_TABLE](../sap-customizing) in SAP.

### Join Functionality

In the *Joins* tab you can define Table Joins.
![Table join ](/img/content/table-join-tab.png){:class="img-responsive"}
