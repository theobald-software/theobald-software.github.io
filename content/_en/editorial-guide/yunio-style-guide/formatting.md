### List


| Recommended | Not recommended | 
| :------ |:--- |
|Select the connection to SAP and select a function:
- Call a function module / BAPI
- Get data from a table or view or report
- Automate a transaction |Please select the connection to SAP and decide, if you want to call a function module / BAPI, get data from a table or view or report, or automate a transaction.

Don't make a list for just one item; a single item doesn't make a proper list. If you want to highlight one item from the nearby text, try a different formatting approach.
Capitalization and end punctuation depend on the type of list and the contents of the list.

Introduce a list with a complete sentence, not a partial one that's completed by the list items.
