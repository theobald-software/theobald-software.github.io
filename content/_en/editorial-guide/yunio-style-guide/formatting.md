Avoid employing directional terminology like "above," "below," or "right-hand side" to guide the reader's orientation. Such language is not effective for accessibility or localization purposes.

Don't make a list for just one item; a single item doesn't make a proper list. If you want to highlight one item from the nearby text, try a different formatting approach.
Capitalization and end punctuation depend on the type of list and the contents of the list.

Introduce a list with a complete sentence, not a partial one that's completed by the list items.
