## Style
When creating content style can be defined as “the way the author writes texts”. In the context of the UI the following aspects are considered: comprehensibility, simplicity, conciseness (as short as possible, as long as needed) and consistent word choice.

Keep in mind that readers have diverse cultural backgrounds and different English reading skills. As much as possible, avoid culturally specific references. Writing in a straightforward and uniform manner can also simplify the translation of documents into other languages.

<!---
Break up walls of text to aid in scannability. For example, separate paragraphs, create headings, and use lists.
Use shorter sentences. Try to use fewer than 26 words per sentence.
Define acronyms and abbreviations on first usage and if they're used infrequently.
Use parallel writing structures for similar things. For example, start each list in the same format.
Place distinguishing and important information of a paragraph in the first sentence to aid in scannability.
Use clear and direct language. Avoid the use of double negatives and exceptions for exceptions.

Recommended: You can continue without a path.

Not recommended: A missing path won't prevent you from continuing.

Left-align text for readability. Don't center or full-justify text.

### Please - Level of Politeness
Excessive politeness, such as using the word "please", can have negative impact. It makes the text longer, your brand seems unsure, and you miss chances to inspire action.

### Simplicity – easy-to-read content
When writing information for users it is important to produce easy-to-read texts. The concept of “easy-to-read” is not universal and it will not be possible to write a text that will suit every reader. Easy-to-read content is generally characterized by:  
• The use of a simple, straightforward language 
• Only one main idea per sentence 
• No usage of abbreviations that were not introduced or not well-known (e.g., XU vs. PC) 
• Clear and logical structure  
Writing in a simple, straightforward language does not mean writing in a childish or simplistic manner. The widest possible audience in terms of customers should be able to understand easy-to-read content. Even if you do feel comfortable with more complex vocabulary, use the simpler synonym if that has the same meaning.
