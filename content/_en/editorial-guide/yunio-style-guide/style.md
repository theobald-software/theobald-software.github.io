## Style
When creating content style can be defined as “the way the author writes texts”. In the context of the UI the following aspects are considered: comprehensibility, simplicity, conciseness (as short as possible, as long as needed) and consistent word choice.

Keep in mind that readers have diverse cultural backgrounds and different English reading skills. As much as possible, avoid culturally specific references. Writing in a straightforward and uniform manner can also simplify the translation of documents into other languages.

Make big chunks of text easier to scan. Split bigger paragraphs into smaller paragraphs, make headings, and use lists.

Use shorter words and shorter sentences. Try to use fewer than 26 words per sentence.

Define acronyms and abbreviations in the beginning.

Use same writing structures for similar things such as lists, procedures etc.

Put the most important information in the first sentence of a paragraph so it's easy to spot when scanning.

Use simple technical and direct language, but don't get to colloquial.

|If Default option is not suitable, provide a custom base URL with protocol and port (e. g., https://yunio.example.com:8175). | If Default doesn't work for you, a custom base URL including protocol and port can be provided (e. g. https://yunio.example.com:8175).|


Don't use double negatives or make things complicated with exceptions for exceptions.

### Please - Level of Politeness
Excessive politeness, such as using the word "please", can have negative impact. It makes the text longer, your brand seems unsure, and you miss chances to inspire action. 

### Comprehensibility

### Simplicity – easy-to-read content
When writing information for users it is important to produce easy-to-read texts. The concept of “easy-to-read” is not universal and it will not be possible to write a text that will suit every reader. Easy-to-read content is generally characterized by:  
• The use of a simple, straightforward language 
• Only one main idea per sentence 
• No usage of abbreviations that were not introduced or not well-known (e.g., XU vs. PC) 
• Clear and logical structure  
Writing in a simple, straightforward language does not mean writing in a childish or simplistic manner. The widest possible audience in terms of customers should be able to understand easy-to-read content. Even if you do feel comfortable with more complex vocabulary, use the simpler synonym if that has the same meaning.  

Try to use easier grammatical constructions, e.g., avoid "neither nor" - construction.
