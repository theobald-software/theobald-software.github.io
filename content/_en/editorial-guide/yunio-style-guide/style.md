## Style
When creating content style can be defined as “the way the author writes texts”. In the context of the UI the following aspects are considered: comprehensibility, simplicity and consistent word choice.

### Comprehensibility

### Simplicity – easy-to-read content
When writing information for users it is important to produce easy-to-read texts. The concept of “easy-to-read” is not universal and it will not be possible to write a text that will suit every reader. Easy-to-read content is generally characterized by:  
• The use of a simple, straightforward language 
• Only one main idea per sentence 
• No usage of abbreviations that were not introduced or not well-known (e.g., XU vs. PC) 
• Clear and logical structure  
Writing in a simple, straightforward language does not mean writing in a childish or simplistic manner. The widest possible audience in terms of customers should be able to understand easy-to-read content. Even if you do feel comfortable with more complex vocabulary, use the simpler synonym if that has the same meaning.
