## Spelling and Grammar
Write English and foreign-language words using US and not UK spelling. For reference you can use the spelling dictionary [Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com). 
The online help Style Guide of Theobald Software also deals with cases that require a more detailed explanation than in the spelling dictionary. 

### Present Tense

Use present tense for general statements about behavior that are not tied to a specific time.

| Recommended | Not recommended | 
| :------ |:--- |
|If parameters are selected for <b>Output</b>, the values are included in the response body of the service.| If parameters are selected for <b>Output</b>, their values will be included in the result of the service |
|The service name is a unique identifier for the service and is included in the URL of the service.|The service name is the unique identifier of this service and will be part of the service's URL. |


### Active Voice
When you're writing, it's usually better to use active voice instead of passive voice. Active voice makes it clear who is doing the action in a sentence. Passive voice can sometimes make it confusing to know who is supposed to do something. For example, it might be unclear if it's the reader, the computer, the server, a user, or a visitor to a website. So, it's generally a good idea to use active voice to make your writing clearer.
Tip: Here is an article on distinguishing active and passive voice: [Active vs. Passive Voice: What's The Difference?](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/active-vs-passive-voice-difference)

### Capitalization
Avoid unnecessary capitalization. Only capitalize words when necessary and consider why it needs to be capitalized. Do not rely on capitalization to convey meaning, as it can be confusing for readers. Avoid using camel case ([CamelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case)), unless it is an official name or referencing code that uses camel case.

Use capital letters in the following ways:
- The first words of a sentence
- Trademarks

### Clause Order

### Punctuation	
Semicolon...
