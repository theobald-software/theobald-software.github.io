## Spelling and Grammar
Write English and foreign-language words using US and not UK spelling. For reference you can use the spelling dictionary [Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com). 
The online help Style Guide of Theobald Software also deals with cases that require a more detailed explanation than in the spelling dictionary.  

### Active voice
When you're writing, it's usually better to use active voice instead of passive voice. Active voice makes it clear who is doing the action in a sentence. Passive voice can sometimes make it confusing to know who is supposed to do something. For example, it might be unclear if it's the reader, the computer, the server, a user, or a visitor to a website. So, it's generally a good idea to use active voice to make your writing clearer.
Tip: Here is an article on distinguishing active and passive voice: [Active vs. Passive Voice: What's The Difference?](https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/active-vs-passive-voice-difference)
