Using **ECS Core** developers have an ideal framework for programming applications in SharePoint Online/ Office 365. 

Applications using ECS Core can basically be developed in any programming language that consumes REST Services. 

**JavaScript library for REST** 

For programming with ECS REST Services and JavaScript we recommend to use our [JavaScript library](https://cdn-files.theobald-software.com/static/theobald.ecs.micro/5.7.0/index.html) (tEcs). 
It's goal is to make client side programming with JavaScript and ECS easier by encapsulating raw methods of ECS. 

**App Development**

For app development please check out the Knowledge Base articles for typical implementation scenarios:
