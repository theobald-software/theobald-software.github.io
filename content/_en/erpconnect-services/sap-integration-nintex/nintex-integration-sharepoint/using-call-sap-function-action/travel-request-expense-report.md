The Nintex integration scenarios **Travel Request** and **Travel Expenses** are two ready-to-use SAP business integration solutions developed by Theobald Software and Nintex. 
 
In the **Travel Request** scenario employees can request business trips with their estimated costs. After successful approval by the responsible manager the travel request is posted to the SAP system generating a trip number.  

In a second step employees can enter their travel expenses for the created business trip using the **Travel Expenses** scenario. The entered travel expenses are posted to the SAP system after approval. It is also possible to create a completely new expense report without prior travel request. By entering the right SAP personell number also a personell administrator could create the expense report for the employee. 

The travel scenarios run completely in SharePoint and Nintex. SAP integration has been accomplished with Theobald Software's [Call SAP Function Action]().     

Both scenarios can be used as templates. You are free to adjust or enhance the solutions according to your individual requirements.
