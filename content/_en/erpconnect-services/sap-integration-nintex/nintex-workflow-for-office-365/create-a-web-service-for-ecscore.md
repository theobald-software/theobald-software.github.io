Nintex for Office 365 supports the execution of RESTful web services. With the WebService Designer and ECS Core Nintex for Office 365 compatible web services can be created.

Two examples about the creation of ECS Core web services in REST and OData format can be found [here](../../ecs-core/webserivce-designer)	.

If you'd like to reproduce the following example for SAP integrated web services in Nintex Workflow for Office 365 you should first create the REST web service for purchase requisition creation.
