With the **Customer Factsheet** solution Theobald Software offers a Business Integration App which is in particularly interesting for sales representatives or managers. The application enables business users to get a quick overview about SAP customer data directly in SharePoint. On a clearly structured screen the most important key figures and sales activities for a given customer number are listed.


**App structure**

The relevant customer information is displayed in different sections after calling a specific customer number. You can only use the app for evaluation purposes and not for editing customer data. Having a direct integration to the SAP system any changes in SAP are displayed in the app immediately after reloading the data.

If customer data is available for the selected number, information about the customer address, key figures and contact person is shown on the upper screen. Basis for this information is the customer master data in SAP. Only if customer information for the selected number is maintained in the SAP system hits will be displayed.
