Launch the *WebService Designer* from the *Start* menu.
As a first step in using the *WebService Designer*, you will configure the connections to the SharePoint system and the SAP system. The SAP System Connection is used at design time to provide metadata about SAP objects for the designer. At runtime an *ERPConnect Services* application is used to provide access to the SAP System. 

The status bar at the bottom left of the *WebService Designer* window will show the status of the connections.
If you develop on a SharePoint Server, the name of the Server will be shown.
The SAP System will initially be undefined.
