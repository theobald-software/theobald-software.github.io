The *WebService Designer* is a component of *ERPConnect Services* which allows you to connect your SharePoint applications to SAP using standard web service protocols. 
With the built-in graphical designer, a power user or solution architect is able to design and deploy a web service providing read/write access to SAP, without the need to write any code. 
The design of the web service is simplified for the user through a graphical editor for modeling a process flow and connecting individual process steps to the SAP objects of your choice.
A wide range from simple to complex business scenarios can be supported with the *WebService Designer*. Typical consumer applications are forms applications (including Nintex Forms), workflow applications, or custom SharePoint applications that require access to SAP business data.
