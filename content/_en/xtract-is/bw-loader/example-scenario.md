In the previous chapters we assumed that data targets (InfoObjects, InfoSource, InfoPackages) are directly modeled in the BW. But the Xtract BW Loader component also offers the possibility of creating all necessary objects right from within the editor.
You will find the BWLoaderSampleDB.sql file in the installation directory. This file contains all necessary SQL commands needed to create and fill in the tables used below in a test database.
