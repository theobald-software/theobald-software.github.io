Xtract IS is required when developing and running SSIS packages. 
Make sure to install Xtract IS on both types of machines:
- On the development machine running Visual Studio / SQL Sever Data Tools. Development can be performed on several machines.
- On the machine running the SQL server, which is used for deploying and running the packages.

{: .box-tip }
**Recommendation:** A regular update of the software is crucial for stable performance, especially major changes and high ([H]) priority
updates. Check the [Version History](https://kb.theobald-software.com/version-history/xtract-is-version-history) for updates. A newer version
can be installed over the older version.

### Prerequisites

- SSIS / Visual Studio Extentions are installed

{: .box-note }
**Note:** administrator permissions are required to install Xtract IS.

To use Xtract IS, the file *XtractISSetup.exe* must be executed and installed **both** on the local development environment (Visual Studio or SSDT) and on the SSIS server. For more information, see section [Licensing](./installing-the-license).

{% include _content/en/requirements/productversion.md %}	

### Interactive Installation

Interactive installation is the standard procedure with GUI. Execute the *XtractISSetup.exe* file and follow the instructions of the setup program.

![XIS_Setup](/img/content/xis/xis_setup-exe.png){:class="img-responsive"}

The Xtract IS Setup installs Xtract IS as a plug-in into SSIS.

The license installation procedure is described in the section [Installing the license](./installing-the-license#installing-the-xtract-is-license---xtractislicensejson).


#### Installation Directory Files
The list below shows several most important files that are placed into the default directory ``C:\Program Files\XtractIS`` after installation:

|Filename | Description |
|:----|:---|
| ABAP Directory | Directory with SAP function modules. Read the readme.txt within the directory for more information. See also [SAP Customizing](../sap-customizing). |
| XtractISSetup.exe | Application for installing and registering the Xtract IS components within SSIS.|
|XtractISConversionPreparer.exe| Tool, which prepares older version of SSIS packages (containing Xtract IS components) for migration to newer versions of SSIS. See also section [SSIS Migration](./ssis-migration).|
| xis_version.bat | Starts the `XtractISVerisonInfo.exe` to display and read the currently installed version.|
| XtractLicenseManager.exe | Application to manage and view licenses.|
| Uninstall Xtract IS| Tool for uninstalling and removing Xtract IS with all its components from your machine. |
| gac-uninstall.bat | **For debugging only**. Tool to clear the GAC of all Xtract IS related components in case of installation issues.|
| Eula_XtractIS.rtf | Document containing the license agreement for the use of the software Xtract IS.|
| XtractISLicense.json | License file with information about the server, the component and runtime. |
| UninstallDllLicense.bat| **For older license files**. See [Updating the Xtract.License.dll to XtractISLicense.json](./installing-the-license#updating-the-xtractlicensedll-to-xtractislicensejson)|



### Unattended Installation

The installation of Xtract IS and the Xtract License Manager can be initiated without the GUI in a non-interactive mode.

#### XtractISSetup.exe
To execute the installation in silent mode, use the switch *--unattended* . <br>

![XIS_Setup-unattended](/img/content/xis/cmd-unattended-switch.png){:class="img-responsive"}

{: .box-note }
**Note:** All switches are case sensitive.

#### XtractLicenseManager.exe
To execute the License Manager in silent mode, pass the path to the license file as a command line argument.

#### Wait until Installation is Complete

`XtractISSetup.exe` and `XtractLicenseManager.exe` are Windows applications, meaning the Windows Command Prompt does not wait until the installation is complete. 

To wait until the installation is complete, use the [start](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/start) command with the `/wait` switch. 

**Examples:**
```
start /wait XtractISSetup.exe --unattended
start /wait XtractLicenseManager.exe "C:\Program Files\XtractIS\XtractISLicense.json"
```


### Displaying the Xtract IS components within Visual Studio
After a successful installation of the Xtract IS, the Xtract IS components are automatically available in the SSIS Toolbox of a Data Flow Task in your Visual Studio Integration Services project.

<!---{: .box-warning }
**Warning! Xtract IS components not visible**<br> With the current version of the SSDT for VS 2015, *SQL Server vNext* or *SQL Server 2017* are selected by default as the target environment for the deployment network of SSIS projects.  With this setting, the Xtract IS components are not visible in the SSIS toolbox. <br> Change the target environment for the deployment to SQL Server 2016 to display the Xtract IS components in the toolbox.
