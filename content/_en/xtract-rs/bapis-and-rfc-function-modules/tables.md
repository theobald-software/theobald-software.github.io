Tables can be entered in and extracted from the function module / BAPI. Therefore, there are two types of behavior for tables: *input type* and *output type*.

To fill a table before BAPI execution set the *Input Type* to *Static* and click on the *Edit* link. You can fill the table’s row with static values or with variables.

To define a table for the use in the report set *Output Type* to Dataset. You can only set one table to this option. All other tables must be set to Skip.
