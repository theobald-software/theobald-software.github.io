**Warning: Deprecated documentation** <br>
You are using the old version of the online help for Board Connector.<br>
Make sure to use the documentation within the new [Board Connector HelpCenter](https://helpcenter.theobald-software.com/board-connector/documentation/introduction/).

An extraction has two types of settings: the *Extraction Settings* include settings that affect only the respective extraction type, while the [General Settings](../getting-started/general-settings) are the same for all extraction types. 

### Opening Extraction Settings
In the window "Extract delta records from tables" click **Extraction Settings**. The window "Table Settings" opens.
