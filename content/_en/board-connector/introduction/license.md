### About licensing concept of Board Connector

Board Connector is licensed per Windows server responsible for extractions. A demo license is automatically installed with the installation of Board Connector. <br>
A regular license is provided after purchasing the product in [My Theobald Software - Portal for Customers and Partners](https://my.theobald-software.com/). The product license is bound to your company and a specific server name.<br>
If you run Board Connector Designer and Board Connector Server on different machines, it is only necessary to replace the license on the server.
 

### Installing the Board Connector license - BOARDConnectorLicense.json
For installing the regular license, place the regular BOARDConnectorLicense.json into the following directory of the server: <br>
`C:\Program Files\BOARDConnector`
 <br>
 ![XU_license](/img/content/BOARDConnector_License_Folder.png ){:class="img-responsive"}
 
A restart of the Board Connector service is no longer necessary.
