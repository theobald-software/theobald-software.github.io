### About Script Expressions

Script expressions offer a way of adding dynamic parameters to Xtract Universal. 
Script expressions are resolved at extraction runtime.
The output of a script expression is a string. 
This string can be used as input for further .NET string operations.

Script expressions can be used as Selection Parameters for [Table](../table/where-clause#script-expressions) or [DeltaQ](../datasource-deltaq/datasource-parameters#script-expressions) extractions.
