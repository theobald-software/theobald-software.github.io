### Basic Functionality - Architecture

BOARD Connector for SAP is a middleware component to extract data from SAP systems and load it into BOARD. Extractions are the main entities in
 BOARD Connector. An [extraction](./getting-started/define-a-table-extraction) is a combination of a [connection to source (SAP system)](./introduction/sap-connection), a connection to BOARD as the destination and the target environment; and a defined extraction type (e.g., [Table](./table)).

BOARD Connector consists of two components:

- Designer to design and configure extractions
- Server to execute extractions

![Architecture-01](/img/content/Architecture-01.png){:class="img-responsive"}

When desigining extractions the user can create and modify extractions, sources and alter the [server settings](./server/server-settings) with the help of the [Designer](./getting-started/bc-designer-overview).
During the execution phase the user can execute the extractions designed in the design phase. 
The execution of the extractions takes place on the [server](./server).
