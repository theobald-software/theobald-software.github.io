In the *Grouping Criteria* tab you can define a criteria using an aggregate function.<br> 
In the *Selection* tab you should define at first the condition with the aggregate function. 

![tj-aggregate-count](/img/content/tj-aggregate-count.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

In the Grouping Criteria tab click *Click here to define criteria*.

![tj-grouping-criteria-0](/img/content/tj-grouping-criteria-0.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Set an aggregate function, a field, an operation and a value.  

![tj-grouping-criteria-1](/img/content/tj-grouping-criteria-1.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Here we defined the condition, that the count of description languages (SPRAS) in the table MAKT is greater or equal 2. 

![tj-grouping-criteria-count](/img/content/tj-grouping-criteria-count.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

Open the SQL window to check the SQL statement.  

![tj-grouping-sql](/img/content/tj-grouping-sql.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}
