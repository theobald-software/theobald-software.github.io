To continue, please preview the report at least once by clicking the *Preview* button.

Use the report column editor at the bottom and the table on the upper right to define manually new columns. A column is defined by its name, offset and length.

To skip rows at the top or at the footer of the report, please use the *Skip Rows Top* and *Skip Rows Bottom* parameters.

Have a look at the second screen shot to get a feeling of how the report should look like when it is properly defined.
