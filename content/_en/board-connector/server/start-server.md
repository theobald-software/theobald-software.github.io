**Example:**

{: .box-warning }
**Warning! Changing the standard ports**<br>
After manually adjusting the default ports, the BOARD Connector Service does not start.<br>
The stored ports are already assigned and need to be adjusted the following [Config files]:<br>
`C:\Program Files\BOARDConnector\config\server\config\general.json`<br>
`C:\Program Files\BOARDConnector\config\server\web\general.json`

### Architecture

BOARD Connector is created for [distributed use](../introduction#basic-functionality---architecture). The BOARD Connector Service can be installed on a central server instance, e.g., a company-wide application server.
`C:\Program Files\BOARDConnector\config` As a result, access to a common BOARD Connector repository is possible and can be used by several BOARD Connector users.

{: .box-tip }
**Tip:** Use the appropriate user rights management in BOARD Connector to make only the users with administrator user rights are allowed to perform fundamental changes on the central repository. See also [Access Management](../security/access-management) for more details.
